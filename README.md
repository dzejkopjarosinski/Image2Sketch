# Image2Sketch
This image-to-sketch converter utilizes NumPy and image.io to detect edges within an image. The detected edges are then transformed into a drawing that resembles a human-like sketch. The process involves analyzing the input image using algorithms to create a pencil-like or outlined representation.
